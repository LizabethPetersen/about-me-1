        <h1>About Richard Livingston</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Richard Livingston.</p>
        <p>As you may already know from my quiz I grew up in Alaska, my favorite food is potatoes with pizza being a close 2nd, and I REALLY love Guardians of the Galaxy...</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Education</h1>
        <h3>Elementary School</h3>
        <p>I went to Elementary School at Susitna Elementary until 4th grade, then moved to Toppenish, WA where I finished elementary there.</p>
        <h3>Middle School</h3>
        <p>I continued middle school in Toppenish, and moved to Portland, OR my 8th grade year where I finished at Kellog Middle School</p>
        <h3>High School</h3>
        <p>I started high school at Franklin High School. I dropped out my senior year and continued my education at Portland Community College until I have a high school diploma equivalent so I could join the U.S. Navy.</p>
        <h3>College</h3>
        <p>I went to PCC but not all the classes I took there were college level courses. Some were high school and some were above. I attended for two years on a full ride scholarship courtesy of Bill Gates and his Gateway to College Program</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Work Experience</h1>
        <p>I worked at OHSU for 2 years as patient transportation while I attended PCC. Once I was done with school I had to leave this job to join the U.S. Navy. In the U.S. Navy I attended school to become a Corpsman but unfortunately was released due to medical reasons. Since exiting the navy I have worked at Washman Carwash for 9 years. I have been promoted 3 times since then. I was promoted to section leader and lead a small group of 5-7 employees. My second promotion I was promoted to team leader, which is a title they give to managers at small stores with less than 10 employees. My last promotion I was promoted to store manager at a much larger store with roughly 30-50 employees.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Goals</h1>
        <p>My goals include learning how to DJ, become a better home cook, and of course learn to code and get a job in the coding industry!</p>
